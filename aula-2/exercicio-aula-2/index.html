                <p class="lead">From ancient times, portraiture has told us fundamental truths about humanity and identity, whoever the subject. Cath Pound explores the genre's most powerful examples.</p>
                <p class="author">By <strong>Cath Pound</strong><br/><time datetime="2022-02-06 18:05">February 6, 2022 - 6:05pm</time></p>
                <p>Portraiture has a unique place in the history of art. By looking at who was portrayed, and how, we are able to gain insights into social, cultural and political history that no other type of painting can offer. The fact that it offers
                    an opportunity to connect with individuals who were, or are, living breathing human beings just like us, also makes it one of the most accessible and popular; it is the only genre with its own dedicated galleries, and has offered inspiration
                    for countless major exhibitions.</p>
                <p>"Portraiture stands apart from other genres of art as it marks the intersection between portrait, biography and history. They are more than artworks; when people look at portraits, they think they are encountering that person," says Alison
                    Smith, chief curator at the National Portrait Gallery in London.</p>

                <img src="assets/portrait.jpg" class="img-large" />
                <p>The genre's origins can be traced back to ancient times, when it served a number of functions, from exalting those in power to remembering the dead. The 1st and 2nd Centuries AD saw the Fayum area of Roman Egypt produce astonishingly naturalistic
                    portraits that appeared on mummy cases. It is thought they may have hung in people's homes during their lifetimes, and after death were placed over the head of their mummy in order to aid their journey to the afterlife. In Ancient
                    Rome portrait sculpture was used to commemorate the dead or celebrate the achievements of the living. In both cases, attention was drawn to the person's lineage, which was of great importance in Roman society. Imperial portraits were
                    a valuable tool for propaganda. Placed in temples of the imperial cult, they were designed to inspire awe and subordination.</p>
                <p>Although few examples of portraiture survive from the Middle Ages, those that do served similar purposes as those from classical times. The stunning life-sized mosaics of the Emperor Justinian and Empress Theodora in the church of San
                    Vitale in Ravenna – which date from the 6th Century – are a particularly spectacular demonstration of power.</p>
