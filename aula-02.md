Presentational HTML x Semantics HTML

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML

A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct Hypertext Markup Language elements are used for the correct purpose at all times.

You might wonder why this is so important. After all, you can use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to make just about any HTML element behave in whatever way you want. 

Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:

Easier to develop with — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
Better on mobile — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
Good for SEO — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <div>s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.

Out there on the web, the truth is that people do some very strange things with HTML markup.

The goal isn't "all or nothing"; every improvement you can make will help the cause of accessibility.

One of the best accessibility aids a screen reader user can have is an excellent content structure with headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.
